 (a)What does the program do?
    //The program outputs a random number based on an input from the user.

 (b)How many methods are there?
    //?
	
 (c)How many lines does each method have?

    //Main = 28 lines
    //randomTo10 = 1 lines 
    //randomMultiply42Plus42 = 1 line
    //randomMultiply42Plus1 = 1 line
    //choose = 2
    //inputNumber = 3 lines
    //random90Plus10 = 2lines

 (d)How many levels of control structure nesting are in main?
    //2 levels

 (e)What does the variable usefulThing do?
    //Gets assigned to the value 0 which is then returned by a method

 (f)What is the purpose  of the if statement on line 6?
    //If the user inputs the number 1, a random number between o to 10 is generated.

 (g)How many control structures are there?
    //2

 (h)How difficult would it be allow the upper and lower bound?
    //Not that difficult since this takes only a few lines of codes.

 (i)How difficult were these questions to answer?
    //If i were to rate this using a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being way too easy and 10 being way too difficult,
      I'd have given it a score of 7.


 (a)How much easier would the questions be to answer based on the current
    format.
         of the code compared to the original format?
         //If i were to rate this using a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being way too easy and 10 being way too difficult,
           I'd have given it a score of 3.

 (b)Using two examples, explain why the current format improves the understandability of the code.
         //The code is now well intended and can be read easily.
         //The variable names are meaningful and the program can be understood 
more easily.
